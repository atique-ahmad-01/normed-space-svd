## Normed Space & Regression Methods

### Python implementations of key linear algebra and regression concepts:

- Total Least Squares (TLS) & OLS – compare line fitting when x and y are noisy.
- PCA & SVD – data decorrelation, dimensionality reduction, and image compression.
- Kernel Regression – linear, polynomial, and RBF regression with MSE analysis.

### Outputs: 
- All generated plots and analysis are saved in the *output/* directory.
### Requirements: 
- numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn

### Run scripts:
```
python tls.py
python pca.py
python kernel.py
```
